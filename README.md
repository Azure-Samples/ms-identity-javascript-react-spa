# React single-page application built with MSAL React and Microsoft identity platform

This sample demonstrates how to use [MSAL React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@azure/msal-react) to login, logout, conditionally render components to authenticated users, and acquire an access token for a protected resource such as Microsoft Graph.

## Features

This sample demonstrates the following MSAL React concepts:

* Configuration
* Login
* Logout
* Conditionally rendering components for authenticated or unauthenticated users
* Acquiring an access token and calling Microsoft Graph

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed to run this sample.

### Setup

1. [Register a new application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/scenario-spa-app-registration) in the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com). Ensure that the application is enabled for the [authorization code flow with PKCE](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow). This will require that you redirect URI configured in the portal is of type `SPA`.
1. Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/ms-identity-javascript-react-spa.git`
1. Open the [/src/authConfig.js](./src/authConfig.js) file and provide the required configuration values.
1. On the command line, navigate to the root of the repository, and run `npm install` to install the project dependencies via npm.

## Running the sample

1. Configure authentication and authorization parameters:
   1. Copy `src/config.example.json` to `src/config.json`.
   2. Replace the `clientId` placeholder string `"Enter_the_Application_Id_Here"` with your app/client ID on AAD Portal.
   3. Replace the `authority` placeholder string `"Enter_the_Cloud_Instance_Id_HereEnter_the_Tenant_Info_Here"` with `"https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/"` (*note*: This is for multi-tenant applications located on the global Azure cloud. For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/quickstart-v2-javascript-auth-code)).
   4. Replace the `redirectUri` placeholder string `"Enter_the_Redirect_Uri_Here"` with the redirect uri you setup on AAD Portal.
2. Configure the parameters for calling MS Graph API:
   1. Replace the `graphMeEndpoint` placeholder string `"Enter_the_Graph_Endpoint_Herev1.0/me"` with `"https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/me"` (*note*: This is for MS Graph instance located on the global Azure cloud. For more information, see the [documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/deployments))
3. To start the sample application, run `npm start`.
4. Finally, open a browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
